# Installing The Plugin

Add lifty as a global plugin so you can use it in all of your sbt projects. You do so by adding the following line to your `~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt` file

    resolvers += Resolver.url("sbt-plugin-releases", new URL("http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
  
    addSbtPlugin("org.lifty" % "lifty" % "1.7.4")

Or if you want to try the SNAPSHOT version    

    resolvers += Resolver.url("sbt-plugin-snapshots", new URL("http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-snapshots/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
  
    addSbtPlugin("org.lifty" % "lifty" % "1.7.5-SNAPSHOT")

and then add the following to your `~/.sbt/build.sbt` file

    seq( Lifty.liftySettings : _*)

Whenever you're in a SBT session you now have the lifty command avaiable. The lifty command has tab-completion enabled to make it faster/easier to use. Try typing lifty and hit tab in an SBT session.
