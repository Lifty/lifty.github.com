# Changelog

## Lifty 1.7.4 is out - 12th of December 2011

**Notice** You will have to re-install the lift recipe because I changed to JSON description and it's no longer able to parse the old file. Sorry.

To use the new version change your ~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt so it has 

	> addSbtPlugin("org.lifty" % "lifty" % "1.7.4")

and then start an SBT session and run 

	> lifty delete lift
	> lifty learn lift https://raw.github.com/Lifty/lifty/master/lifty-recipe/lifty.json

**Changes**

- Added tab-completion (awesome!)
- No longer use Scalate for template rendering for the following reasons
	- Less dependencies
	- Avoid the extra compilation step
	- Hardly used any of its features
- Template rendering is now done in parallel
- Downloading of templates are done in parallel
