# Teaching Lifty Recipes

Now that you have Lifty installed you need to teach it how to generate different files for you. You do so by pointing lifty to a recipe. Here's what you would have to type to teach Lifty about Lift projects and templates

	> lifty learn lift https://raw.github.com/Lifty/lifty/master/lifty-recipe/lifty.json

This tells `lifty` that you want to add a new recipe and give it the name `lift` and that lifty can find the description of the recipe at the given url.

Now you can create a fresh Lift webapp and start it simply by typing the following in an sbt session:

	> lifty create lift project
	> reload          
	> container:start
	> container:stop

Now point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`
